## Installation

To reproduce the visualizations locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electric-vehicle-data.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd electric-vehicle-data`
3. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`

## Usage

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can create the visualizations by running the ipynb files.

This will generate various plots and charts to explore the electric vehicle data.

## Credits

- The dataset used in this project was sourced from kaggle and self prefomed research
- Special thanks to the Python and data visualization communities for their valuable contributions.

## Visualizations

Here are some of the visualizations generated by this project:

- Histogram of Total Electric Vehicle
- Boxplot of Total Electric Vehicle
- Scatterplot of Total Electric Vehicle vs. No. of Charging Stations
- Bar Chart of Total Electric Vehicle by State/UT
- Histogram of Total Non-Electric Vehicle
- Stacked Bar Chart of Total Electric and Non-Electric Vehicles by State/UT
- Scatter Plot of Total Electric Vehicle vs. No. of Charging Stations with Hue

Explore these visualizations to gain insights into the electric vehicle landscape in different states and union territories in India.
